			Welcome to PEAKS Board Game site<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			Peaks is a game of skill and luck for 2 players where the objective is to match black and white sides of triangles before the other player. However only 2 of  the triangles sides are visible at any one time leaving an air of mystery to other side. Players take turns to roll a dice which gives them an amount of points to spend per turn. A list of moves for varying costs are used during the players turn, moves include; turning, swapping, stealing triangles etc.
